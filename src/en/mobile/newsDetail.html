                    <pre>On May 25th, the strictest privacy law in history, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, was officially launched in 28 member states of the European Union. At the same time, due to its global influence, all companies around the world that run business in the EU or to the EU residents will be restrained by the regulation.

In the first half of this year, with the increasing attention to data privacy issues, the global Internet ecosystem experienced a period of turmoil:

In March, Facebook was exposed to "Cambridge Analysis" scandal, and its stock price plunged;

In March, the topic of “Chinese users are willing to sacrifice privacy for efficiency” caused controversy;

In April, China’s burgeoning Internet unicorn company was ordered to rectify their data protection mechanisms.

In recent years, the global pattern of personal data regulation is undergoing profound changes, involving individuals, regulators, companies and academics in various fields around the world. As more and more countries legislate and strengthen corresponding rules, the trend of strengthening personal data protection is rising rapidly.

Ms. Meglena Kuneva, the Consumer Affairs Committee member of the European Commission believed that personal data is the new energy source of the Internet. In order to maximize the value of data, data must be collected, evaluated, and analyzed, and data must be allowed to flow freely across the border, provided that reasonable safeguards are enacted.

Not only the well-known companies like Facebook will have to comply with GDPR, but also any other company dealing with sensitive personal data including healthcare providers, insurance companies, banks will have to obey the regulation. GDPR will have a significant impact on how to protect or leverage the data of people's network footprints, apps and services used.

As a result, more companies have invested their vision in the field of technology implementation of privacy protection. As a next-generation computing architecture for the future, PlatON is committed to providing a secure shared service platform under the premise of data privacy protection by leveraging blockchain and cryptography technology to enable data owners and users to implement secure data sharing under appropriate private protection.

Through the PlatON platform, global multi-source heterogeneous data and computing resources can be integrated for collaborative computing, and cryptographic techniques such as Secure Multi-party Computing and Verifiable Computation can be applied to ensure data privacy and verifiability of computation.


Take the example of data privacy protection issues faced by healthcare providers mentioned above:

The medical health and genetic data of individuals has the most demanding privacy requirements as well as the greatest amount of data. Based on the PlatON, an open service platform for medical information can be built，which shares unified and universal data exchange standards, to realize the interconnection and interoperability of heterogeneous data among different organizations, thereby promoting the further analysis and use of medical and genetic data.
Medical institutions can be free to join or leave the unified open service platform as data sources or network nodes. At the same time, the actual data remains in the local systems of the medical institutions, which could fully guarantee data security while minimizing the cost of technical changes in existing systems.

The innovative combination of blockchain and cryptography technology has huge potential. In terms of data privacy protection and data sovereignty, PlatON offers more possibilities. PlatON allows individuals to have more control over their own data by providing full privacy protection, therefore promotes the exchange and analysis of data, which will lead us to a new digital age.
